# GrowthForce

This program is intended to help [B+ foundation](https://bepositive.org) identify and target users to increase donations overall using data visualizations. It uses machine learning to determine target users in select regions and current data of donors and donor networks to identify top contributors and those with most referrals.

## Project Overview

For the cancer organization we created a way for them to visualize and utilize data that they never previously had access to. With the new data they would have been given using our solution they would be able to track users and retain students, which were a large portion of the user base, after the four years they had during college.
